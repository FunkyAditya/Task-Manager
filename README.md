# Task Manager

This project is a **Task Manager** built using **React**,Â and **Express.js**.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Running the Application

#### 1. Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the backend directory and run:

```sh
node server.js
```

This will start the Express.js server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

#### 2. Start the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and run:

```sh
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the React app in your browser.

### Available Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. It bundles and optimizes React for better performance.

#### `npm run eject`
